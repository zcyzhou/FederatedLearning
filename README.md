# FederatedLearning

## Development Rule
Please develop in Pycharm IDE. Everytime before pushing code please make sure:
1. Pull and solve conflict everytime **before push**
2. Make sure there is no **error** or **warning** prompt in IDE auto check.
   (There should only be a green check mark in the Pycharm)
3. Please comment any modification clearly. Do not use `git add --all`. Add
the files and comment them separately.
